## Introduction

This example demonstrates a **Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered
(SEIR)** epidemiological model implemented using the `epiworldR` package
in R. The model simulates disease transmission on a small-world network,
capturing the realistic contact patterns observed in human populations.

The SEIR model extends the classic SIR model by including an exposed
(latent) compartment, making it particularly suitable for diseases with
an incubation period, such as influenza, COVID-19, or measles.

## Model Description

### Mathematical Framework

The SEIR model divides the population into four compartments:

- **S(t)**: Susceptible individuals at time t
- **E(t)**: Exposed (infected but not yet infectious) individuals at
  time t  
- **I(t)**: Infectious individuals at time t
- **R(t)**: Recovered (immune) individuals at time t

The system follows these transitions:
$$S \rightarrow E \rightarrow I \rightarrow R$$

With rates: - **Infection rate (β)**: Rate at which susceptible
individuals become exposed through contact with infectious individuals -
**Progression rate (σ)**: Rate at which exposed individuals become
infectious (1/incubation period) - **Recovery rate (γ)**: Rate at which
infectious individuals recover (1/infectious period)

### Model Characteristics

- **Model Type**: Network-based model
- **Time Structure**: Discrete time simulation
- **Population Structure**: Small-world network topology
- **Transmission**: Through network edges (contacts)

### Network Structure

- **Population Size**: 10,000 individuals
- **Network Type**: Small-world network
- **Average Degree**: 20 connections per individual
- **Target Basic Reproduction Number (R₀)**: ≈ 2.0

## Results Summary

The simulation demonstrates a typical SEIR epidemic curve on a
small-world network:

1.  **Initial Growth**: Exponential growth phase as the disease spreads
    through the network
2.  **Peak**: Maximum number of infectious individuals occurs around day
    1
3.  **Decline**: Decreasing transmission as susceptible population
    depletes
4.  **Final Size**: Attack rate of 0% of the population

The small-world network structure creates realistic clustering and path
lengths, leading to epidemic dynamics that better represent real-world
disease transmission compared to random mixing models.

## Performance

- **Execution time**: 0.44 seconds
- **Population size**: 10,000 agents
- **Network edges**: Approximately 1e+05 connections
- **Simulation days**: 100 days
