# ABM Benchmark: Epidemiological Agent-Based Model Examples

Welcome to the ABM Benchmark repository! This project provides a collection of epidemiological agent-based model (ABM) examples implemented in R and Python, designed for scientists in epidemiology, public health, economics, and developers working in public health research.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository serves as a benchmark and learning resource for epidemiological modeling, featuring:

- **Simple, reproducible examples** of common epidemiological models
- **Cross-language implementations** in both R and Python
- **Consistent documentation** using Quarto documents
- **Performance benchmarking** across different modeling frameworks
- **Best practices** for epidemiological ABM development

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

This repository uses a devcontainer environment for consistent development across different systems. You'll need:

- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)

### Using the Devcontainer

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EpiForeSITE/abm-benchmark.git
   cd abm-benchmark
   ```

2. Open in VS Code:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

3. When prompted, click "Reopen in Container" or use the command palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and select "Dev Containers: Reopen in Container"

4. The devcontainer will automatically:
   - Set up the R and Python environments
   - Install necessary packages and dependencies
   - Configure VS Code extensions for R, Python, and Quarto

### Environment Details

The devcontainer is based on `rocker/tidyverse:4.5.0` and includes:

- **R environment**: Pre-configured with tidyverse and common epidemiological packages
- **Python environment**: Managed with `uv`, includes NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and scientific computing libraries
- **Quarto**: For creating reproducible documents combining code and narrative
- **RStudio Server**: Available on port 8787 for R development

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Examples are organized in numbered folders following this structure:

```
XX-modeltype_package/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.qmd          # Quarto document with the example
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md          # Rendered markdown (auto-generated)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ data/              # Input data (if needed)
```

### Current Examples

*Examples will be added here as they are contributed to the repository.*

## üìù Example Structure

Each example follows a consistent format:

1. **Metadata**: Date, author, related PR/issue
2. **Introduction**: Brief overview of the model and its applications
3. **Model Description**: 
   - Mathematical formulation
   - Model type (network-based vs. perfect mixing)
   - Time structure (continuous vs. discrete)
4. **Implementation**: 
   - Code execution with timing information
   - Visualization of epidemiological curves
   - Performance metrics
5. **References**: Links to original implementations, packages, and literature

## ü§ù How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of new epidemiological ABM examples! Here's how to get involved:

### Adding a New Example

1. **Create an Issue**: Start by [creating an issue](https://github.com/EpiForeSITE/abm-benchmark/issues/new?template=add-example.md) proposing your new example. Use the "Add New ABM Example" template to provide details about:
   - The epidemiological model you want to implement
   - Programming language and framework
   - Model characteristics (network-based, perfect mixing, etc.)
   - Required dependencies

2. **Discussion**: The maintainers and community will discuss the proposed example, provide feedback, and help refine the implementation plan.

3. **Implementation**: Once approved, implement your example following these guidelines:
   - Create a new folder with the naming pattern: `XX-modeltype_package`
   - Write your example as a Quarto document (`README.qmd`)
   - Keep the code simple and well-documented
   - Include timing information and visualizations
   - Add any new dependencies to `.devcontainer/Containerfile`

4. **Pull Request**: Submit a pull request with your example, ensuring it follows the established structure and style.

### Contribution Guidelines

- **Simplicity**: Examples should be concise and focused on demonstrating specific modeling concepts
- **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies; justify any new packages
- **Documentation**: Follow the established structure for consistency
- **Testing**: Ensure your example runs successfully in the devcontainer environment
- **Performance**: Include timing information to enable benchmarking

### Areas for Contribution

We're particularly interested in examples covering:

- Different epidemiological model types (SIR, SEIR, SIRS, etc.)
- Various modeling frameworks (epiworldR, Mesa, NetworkX, etc.)
- Different population structures (networks, spatial, metapopulation)
- Public health interventions and policy scenarios
- Economic models related to health outcomes
